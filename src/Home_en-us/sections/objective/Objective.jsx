                    <p>
                    I started my career as a Python programmer in April 2022, building a solid understanding of programming logic. In November, I began specializing more in front-end development, and over time, I deepened my knowledge of various concepts across different languages.
                    <br/><br/>

                    My professional goal is to continuously improve my skills as a developer and create useful, enjoyable interfaces. However, I’m not currently looking for opportunities exclusively in this field and am open to new job possibilities.
                    </p>

        </>
